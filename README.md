Fake Authentication Application for Linux

This application simulates a user authentication process on a Linux system. It accepts user inputs, such as a target MAC address and an own MAC address, and uses them as part of a mock authentication procedure. While it does not perform any real authentication, it mimics the process to demonstrate how user input can interact with a systemâ€™s authentication workflow.

This tool is designed for educational purposes and should only be used in controlled environments to better understand authentication mechanisms. It is important to note that using this application for unauthorized access or in real-world scenarios without permission is illegal and unethical.
